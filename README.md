# SharpmakeUtils
This repository has [Sharpmake](https://github.com/ubisoft/Sharpmake) as a submodule and you can use:
`buildsharpmake.bat`
to build sharpmake and copy the binary files to the `bin` folder.

The C# files inside the `utils` folder are some helpers to make it easier to setup projects.
An example of how these helpers can be used are found in the [SharpmakeTemplate](https://github.com/fpuma/SharpmakeTemplate) repository
